## Node practice projects

This repository is a collection of practice projects used for enhancing proficiency with mainly Node.js, as well as Express.js, MongoDB, and Socket.io

* **Chat Application** 
  - Simple chat applcation uses socket.io
    - Users can join rooms and send messages to each other
    - Program tracks users who are online

* **Task manager** 
  - Allows the users to store tasks, and add pictures to each task
    - Data persistency achieved with Mongoose/MongoDB
